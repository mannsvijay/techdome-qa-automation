Prompt #1
What I asked: Read CLAUDE.md and docs/QA-Playwright-Assignment.pdf. Then update playwright.config.ts: set baseURL to    
  https://techdome.io, workers to 4, screenshot and trace on failure, and keep only the chromium project    
  for now. Do not write any tests yet. Show me the diff before applying it.

What Claude did: Showed a diff for playwright.config.ts: baseURL, workers 4, trace retain-on-failure, screenshot only-on-failure, removed firefox/webkit.
What I changed / accepted / rejected: Accepted all of it. Added retries: 1 myself because the target is a live site. Verified workers is under the 5-user limit.

## Prompt #2
**What I asked:** Read docs/exploration-notes.md and write docs/user-story-map.md from it only, using the exact template from the PDF. Cover: Navigation 2, Contact form 2, CTAs and external links 2, Mobile 2, API/form integration 3, Security 2, Load 1, plus 2 to 3 extra stories. Do not invent anything that is not in the notes.

**What Claude did:** Wrote 17 stories (US-001 to US-017) covering all minimum areas plus 3 extras. It kept unverified items as "to confirm when tests run" instead of asserting outcomes.

**What I changed / accepted / rejected:**
[Write your real edits, for example: rewrote US-00X acceptance criteria to match the real error text I saw; changed priority of US-0XX from P0 to P2; deleted criterion ... because it was not on the site.]
